Pointer, Function, Inline Function, Recursion in C++: 

8.1 Task: Will the program through an error and if yes then why?

int *p = {10,20,20};

cout << *p;

p++;

cout << *p;

Error: Too many initializer values.

8.2 Task: Output of this program?

V1. Issue?

int arr[] = {10,20,30};

cout << *arr;

cout << arr;

arr++;

cout << *arr;

--- arr cannot be modifiend -------------

V2.How to resolve above issue?

int arr[] = {10,20,30};

cout << *arr;

cout << arr;

cout << *(?);



8.3 Task: Output of this program?

V1. Output?

int a = 10;

int *p;

int **q;

p = &a;

q = &p;

cou << *p;

cou << **q;

V2. Change the value of a using q pointer to pointer.


8.4 Task: Find factorial of a number using function but not recurssion

8.5 Task: Find factorial of a number using recurssion

8.6 Task: Series Problem using recurssion for n series

2, (2^2 + 2), (3^3 + 3), (4^4 + 4), (5^5 + 5), .......

Hint:

n * ((n-1)^(n-1) + (n-1))



8.7 Task: Perform Call by value, call by Address for swapping value of a and b:

int a = 10;

int b = 20;

V1. Swap(a,b); //call by Value [void swap(int a, int b){}]

V2. Swap(a,b); //call by Value [void swap(int &a, int &b){}]

V3. Swap(&a,&b); //call by Address
